description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cline rules for the WoodLab Configurator project.
globs: .clinerules/**/*.txt
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [woodlab-configurator-workflow.txt](mdc:.clinerules/workflow/woodlab-configurator-workflow.txt) for workflow rules
  - Example: [main.js](mdc:js/main.js) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```javascript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  export function showBanner(msg) { ... }

  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  function showbanner() { ... } // inconsistent naming
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with a high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation using WoodLab files and conventions
  - Reference the WoodLab guidelines and actual code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules
  - Treat `AGENTS.md` (repo root) as the primary source of truth for shared project constraints; keep `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.clinerules/**` aligned on shared constraints while preserving tool-specific guidance/formatting.

- **Tailoring Rules for WoodLab Configurator:**
  - **Module Best Practices:**
    - Write rules that encourage clear `export` and `import` statements in `js/main.js`, `js/viewer.js`, and `js/ui/*.js`.
    - Emphasize single responsibility for modules (e.g., `viewer.js` handles 3D scene, `banner.js` handles banners).
    - Use consistent naming conventions for exported functions and variables.
    - Example Rule: "UI modules must only observe state and dispatch 'statechange' events; only main.js mutates state."
  - **UI/UX and Accessibility:**
    - Create rules for accessibility (focus outlines, ARIA, keyboard navigation) and responsive layout.
    - Include guidelines for managing event listeners and DOM updates in a static, client-only context.
    - Provide examples for rules related to placeholder assets, banners, tooltips, and help drawer.
    - Example Rule: "All placeholder images must have alt='placeholder'."
  - **Code Structure for Static Web Apps:**
    - Develop rules that guide the organization of code related to the locked tech stack (Three.js, Tailwind, jsPDF, html2canvas).
    - Include guidelines for managing the 3D viewer, UI state, and export features.
    - Suggest rules for structuring the build pipeline and deployment for GitHub Pages compatibility.

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge in the WoodLab codebase
  - Add examples from actual WoodLab code
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual WoodLab code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules
  - Format commands for **PowerShell** if needed
  - When using tools to run commands or make edits, consolidate their uses as much as possible
  - When analyzing and coming to a conclusion, include 1 or 2 sentences that explain the actions being taken
  - When something is done, decide if it is a significant enough action to request an image be shared back for further analysis
  - When editing files, consolidate changes per-file rather than per-rule
  - Add a one-line summary of the actions taken in addition to each response for saving changes. Examples: "Changed the style of the banner for accessibility"; "Refactored viewer.js to separate rendering logic". Separate multiple actions with a semicolon.

- **WoodLab-Specific Requirements:**
  - All rules must align with the WoodLab Configurator's static, client-only, and GitHub Pages-compatible requirements.
  - Reference the locked tech stack and strict file/folder structure as described in the project guidelines.
  - Ensure all rules reinforce the use of placeholder data/assets, accessibility, and responsive design.

## Implementation Instructions

1. Place this file at the indicated path inside `.clinerules/meta/`.
2. Run **“Cline: Reload Rules”** in VS Code or restart the Cline LSP/CLI so it picks up changes.
3. Edit the `globs` pattern above if your project structure differs.
4. Keep this guideline file under version control so the team shares the same conventions.
