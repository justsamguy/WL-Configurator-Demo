description: Guidelines for continuously evolving Cline rules for the WoodLab Configurator project.
globs: .clinerules/**/*.txt
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns in the WoodLab Configurator not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across WoodLab files (e.g., in `js/main.js`, `js/viewer.js`, `js/ui/*.js`)
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented in the WoodLab context
  - New best practices or updates to the locked tech stack (Three.js, Tailwind, jsPDF, html2canvas)
  - Changes in accessibility, placeholder, or deployment requirements

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new WoodLab code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized for WoodLab (e.g., state management, UI modules, placeholder usage)
  - Reference the WoodLab guidelines and workflow file for context ([woodlab-configurator-workflow.txt](mdc:.clinerules/workflow/woodlab-configurator-workflow.txt))
  - Check for consistent error handling, accessibility, and responsive design patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage in the WoodLab codebase

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ WoodLab files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New accessibility, performance, or deployment requirements emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the WoodLab codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered in WoodLab usage
    - Related rules or guidelines have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed (e.g., new version of a locked library)

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```javascript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const banner = document.getElementById('banner');
  banner.addEventListener('click', handleBannerClick);

  // Consider adding a rule to ensure:
  // - Event listeners are added and removed consistently in UI modules.
  // - Only main.js mutates state; UI modules dispatch 'statechange' events.
  // - Accessibility attributes (e.g., aria-live) are present where required.
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules must be actionable, specific, and relevant to the WoodLab Configurator
  - Examples should come from actual WoodLab code
  - References should be up to date with WoodLab guidelines
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced across the WoodLab project

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments and QA walkthroughs for WoodLab
  - Track common development questions and issues in the WoodLab context
  - Update rules after major refactors or guideline changes
  - Add links to relevant WoodLab documentation and workflow files
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated, especially if WoodLab guidelines change
  - Remove rules that no longer apply to the WoodLab project
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with WoodLab code
  - Update references to WoodLab guidelines and workflow files
  - Keep `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.clinerules/**` synchronized on shared constraints (without overwriting tool-specific instructions/formatting)
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes

- **WoodLab-Specific Requirements:**
  - All rule evolution must align with the WoodLab Configurator's static, client-only, and GitHub Pages-compatible requirements.
  - Do not introduce server-side code, unsupported libraries, or break the locked file/folder structure.
  - Reference the locked tech stack and placeholder/accessibility policies as described in the project guidelines.

## Implementation Instructions

1. Place this file at the indicated path inside `.clinerules/meta/`.
2. Run **“Cline: Reload Rules”** in VS Code or restart the Cline LSP/CLI so it picks up changes.
3. Edit the `globs` pattern above if your project structure differs.
4. Keep this guideline file under version control so the team shares the same conventions.
