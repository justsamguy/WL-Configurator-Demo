## Brief overview
This document provides high-level notes on testing for the WoodLab Configurator project.

## Testing Recommendations
- Note: Testing must occur in a live server environment due to CDN dependencies.
- Recommendation: Deploy changes to verify functionality.
- Next steps: Ensure all features work as expected and address any issues.
- **Important:** Do not suggest or run local testing commands unless explicitly requested. All testing and verification must be done via GitHub Pages deployment.
