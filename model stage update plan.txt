The app's navigation stages are to be modified so the user picks a model first, then a design (instead of a single-stage model select). 
A new stage called "Models" will be added as the first stage, and showcase different tables. The current model stage will be renamed "designs" and show the model's design choices using the existing tile layout.
different models have different price points, so their respective designs will need to be priced individually even if a design is identical across models.

Models:
coffee 
dining
conference

designs:
river
slab
encasement
custom

model-specific designs:
keystone (conference only)
signature (coffee only)
round (dining and coffee)
