  <!-- Persistent Header
       Note: keep the header minimal and sticky; the summary button is intentionally
       moved out of the sticky header (below) so it will scroll with the sidebar content
       and remain inline with the live price. See the price-row markup for the summary
       button — keeping these together ensures the price and its summary control stay
       on the same line and do not become visually separated when the header is sticky.
