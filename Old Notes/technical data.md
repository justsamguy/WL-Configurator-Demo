**Material Properties:**
- the density (in lb/ft³) for each wood type (Black Walnut 35-38, Spalted Maple 30-40, American Elm 35-38, Siberian Elm 30-38, Sycamore 24-37, Ash 30-42, Claro Walnut 40+)
- hardness rating (Janka scale/lbf) for each wood type (Black Walnut 950-1100, Spalted Maple 700-1100, American Elm 800-900, Siberian Elm 800-950, Sycamore 720-850, Ash 1200-1350, Claro Walnut 1000-1200)

**Finish Specifications:**
- 2K poly application is a single coat. osmo finishes are multiple coats, each can be listed (1st coat, 2nd coat, top coat). With osmo finish, the top coat is always Ceramic Pro Strong 1000.
- 2K poly keeps its name, the natural oil is osmo. 
- Sheen for 2K is Satin = 20 sheen, Matte = 10 sheen, Gloss = 30 sheen
- Sheen for osmo is Satin = 3043 Clear Satin, Matte = 3031 Clear Matte, Gloss = 3011 Clear Gloss
- non-clear tints with 2K are custom
- clear tint with osmo means the base coat is 1101 clear satin. Natural replaces the base coat with 3051 Raw Matte, and darken replaces it with 3166 Walnut.

**Color/Epoxy Details:**
- There are 2 layers of epoxy: first is a seal coat, <.25" in thickness, matching colors. Second is the river (2-2.5" thick).
- pigment composition for each color - all gradients should be specified as dark on one end and light on the other.
Multi Blue Ocean, Maui, Caribbean gradient
Multi-Grey Caviar, Dolphin, Pearl gradient
Copper Blend Espresso, Coral, Pineapple gradient
Multi-Green Jungle, Emerald, Candy Apple gradient

**Leg Specifications:**
- Leg sizes are calculated or determined by a lookup based on the tabletop size.
- setback distances from side is calculated by the tabletop width and leg size. include setback to leg and setback to plate spearately.
- setback distances from end (to leg) is 12-14" under 10', and 18-20" 10' and above. for coffee tables, the setback is 5-7" from end.
-  wall thickness (gauge) for tubes is 14 (.083).
- exceptions: cube bases are 0.25" setback on all sides, round design tripods are 12-14" on all sides, cookie tripods are 12"+ (roughly even) all sides and height is TBD. Heights of legs below assume table is standard height, but can be calculated to other dimensions (table height - 2" top thickness).

 LEG LOGIC:
 ≤36" Table - 26W
36-42" Table - 28W
43-48" Table - 32W
≥48" Table - Calculate leg size: Tabletop width -6" to get mounting plate length, tabletop width - 10" to get leg width.
