Tabletop: widthxlengthx2x.03. Lengths over 96" add an extra 20lbs per 12".
Legs: squared/tapered 70lb, X/hourglass 90lb, (weights per single leg in 3x1 tube to handle logic affecting leg qty) tripod/custom 110lb  (total weights in 3x1 tube). 
2x4 Tube is 3x1 tube weight x 1.52
at 42" table height, leg weight is 1.5x. (determine an appropriate multiplier based off of this for all possible heights).
table widths over 42" have a 1.1x multiplier for each 6" width increase
cube/C-style base is a flat 40lb. 

Waterfall edge increases tabletop cubic inches by table widthxtableheightx2 and reduces leg weight by half (completely if double waterfall).
Glass top increases weight by widthxlengthx0.25x0.1
power strips adds 20lbs, wireless charging and adtl connections add 10lbs each, innerlighting adds 30lbs, custom tech adds 30lbs.

As a final buffer, multiply the total table weight by a packaging value of 1.25.
