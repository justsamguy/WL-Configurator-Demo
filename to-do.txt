add effects to the website to make it feel more polished:
Add an info ⓘ button to the right side of each tile's title. when this button is selected, use a card-flip transition on the tile to reveal "the other side", where the description is centered horizontally and vertically in the tile with the only other element being an X button in the top left to return to the front view of the tile. this does not apply to addons. For the custom resin color tile in tabletop, instead of the infobutton the card flips over when the tile is selected to reveal the custom input. it flips back if de-selected.
change the feedback of the copy configuration button to fade into green with the message "Copied ✓" and then back. remove the text that pops up below it. make the same animation for the download PDF button "Download Complete ✓".
change the top navbar button design: make all the buttons parallellograms slanted towards the right, remove rounded corners, and remove space between the buttons in such a way the right side of a button is nested up against the left side of the next button. on the ends (models and summary), have their respective left and right ends vertical instead of diagonal.
