The WoodLab Configurator app structure, core logic, and UI scaffolding are now in place. The following has been accomplished:
- All required directories and files have been created, including index.html, .nojekyll, css/styles.css, js/main.js, js/viewer.js, js/ui/banner.js, and the assets subdirectories.
- The main layout, stage bar, 3D viewer, sidebar, banners, and help drawer are implemented in index.html.
- js/main.js manages global state, stage navigation, sidebar rendering, and model selection logic for Stage 1, including price updates and visual selection.
- js/viewer.js sets up the Three.js 3D viewer with a placeholder box and camera controls.
- js/ui/banner.js provides a reusable notification/banner system.
- Asset directories are present and ready for images, icons, and models.

**Note:** Due to a system limitation, I was unable to create the SVG placeholder images for the model options. Please manually add the following SVG files to assets/images/:

assets/images/model1.svg:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg width="256" height="256" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="256" height="256" fill="#cccccc"/>
  <text x="50%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle" font-size="32" fill="#666666" font-family="Arial, sans-serif">Model 1</text>
</svg>
```
assets/images/model2.svg:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg width="256" height="256" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="256" height="256" fill="#cccccc"/>
  <text x="50%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle" font-size="32" fill="#666666" font-family="Arial, sans-serif">Model 2</text>
</svg>
```
assets/images/model3.svg:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg width="256" height="256" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="256" height="256" fill="#cccccc"/>
  <text x="50%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle" font-size="32" fill="#666666" font-family="Arial, sans-serif">Model 3</text>
</svg>
```

Once these SVGs are added, the model selection UI will display correctly. The logic and structure are fully aligned with the provided guidelines and ready for further feature development or testing.

**Logic for this approach:**  
- I prioritized direct static file creation and CDN usage to match your deployment environment and avoid unnecessary build steps.
- I used SVGs for placeholders because they are lightweight, scalable, and easy to edit or replace.
- The app structure and code are modular and follow the definitive guidelines, ensuring maintainability and extensibility.

You can now proceed to test the app, and the next steps would be to implement Stage 2 (customization), Stage 3 (summary/export), and further UI polish as needed.
